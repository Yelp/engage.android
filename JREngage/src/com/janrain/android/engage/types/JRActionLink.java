/**
 * @brief
 * A link a user can use to take action on an activity update on the provider.
 *
 * Create an action link object, fill in the object's fields, and add the object
 * the JRActivityObject#mActionLinks array of your JRActivityObject.
 *
 * Each action link must contain a link: \e href, and some text describing what action
 * will happen if someone clicks the link: \e text.
 *
 * @par Example:
 * @code
 * action_links:
 * [
 *   {
 *     "text": "Rate this quiz result",
 *     "href": "http://example.com/quiz/12345/result/6789/rate"
